# Pose-Detection

Hello there! I have created a software program that is able to detect the position of any moving object. For the implementation I have used different python libraries as Argparse, OpenCV.

I have created a basic PB trained model that is being operated by TensorFlow Machine Learning Algorithm using OpenCV and Deep Neural Network to read the network of the same PB file.

Used the screen grid and dimensions to define the positional parameters and VideoCapture feature of OpenCV to process and detect the body parts of a moving object.

Project has wide applications in tracking the movements. Interested to learn more about TensorFlow Neural Networking and Deep learning Concepts to try more of such.
